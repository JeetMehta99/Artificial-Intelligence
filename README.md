# Name: Jeet Mehta
## In this coursework I have implemented various algorithms on "n puzzle" problem and leveraged various heuristics. 
## Implemented MDP on Grid World.
## Decision Tree implementation and then pruned the tree. Used a restaurant.csv file for implementation. Leveraged chi square test libraries(scipy.stats)
## This was a part of my coursework at UIC in CS411 Artificial Intelligence taken under the guidance of Prof. Piotr Gmytrasiewicz.
